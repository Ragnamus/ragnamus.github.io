The Newtonian formalism is great and all when dealing with independent differential equations but as soon as the idea of constraints is introduced, things start looking less nice. Essentially, constraints can make coordinates non-independent and as a result, the problem becomes a set of coupled differential equations, which are not desirable to solve, especially not analytically.
